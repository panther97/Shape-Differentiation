# Shape-Differentiation
A multi-class classification model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) written on Torch and python and is trained with an accuracy of over 98% on a data set of 90000, 200*200 images which have 9 classes of different shapes.

<b>Input for the model is an Image which os one the 9 shapes. <b><br>
Output is the recognition of the shape in the image.<br>
